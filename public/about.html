<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my Portofolio. <p>

<h4>Here is a little bit about myself</h4>

<p>My name is Stefania and I am 24 years old. I was born and raised in Romania, but I have been living in Germany for the last 
  4 years. At the moment I am studying Computer Sciente at the Technical University of Central Hesse. Meanwile I am also trying to start my
  career as a Web Developer. I try to perfect my skills every day and I am always eager to learn something new.

<h4>Here is how my passion began</h4>

<p>I had my first contact with programming in Highschool. At the beginning everything
  seemed very confusing. After puttin in some effort, I realised that this is somethingthat I see myself
  doing in the future. So I slowly startet to work harder and harder and I ended up developing
  my passion for programming. <br>
